From Iskander Belhouchet
I am from Tunisia, I am a student at Higher institute of computer science in mahdia

I have applied for this financial for many reasons which I will mention it later.

first, I still a student so I can not afford any money, also my father income can not afford this courses,

I can say that we deal in our country with the pound, not with dollars, it is so so so difficult to pay for all courses,

I can say that we deal in our country with the pound, not with dollars, it is so so so difficult to pay for all courses,

my daily routine is very busy, I can not take a job beside my college, even if I have worked to take these online courses, our currency is very very very low with respect to dollars.

so, all circumstances are against to pay for this courses, for these reasons and other reasons I wish I can take this course for no charges,

I hope so, so I can achieve my goals and take this course which I think will help me a lot.

also, I wish I can be able to afford all courses the future. I wish this financial aid be accepted, so I can take this course for no charges,

really I am in bad need for this course, so it will help me a lot, if this financial aid has been accepted, I will be thank you for giving me this chance to take this course and to learn online for free.
